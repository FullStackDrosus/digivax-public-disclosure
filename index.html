  <p>  HERO SECTION
    
DigiVax™
Digital Immunity at the Protocol Layer
We are not pricing usage.
We are pricing the elimination of quantum migration risk and the right to assert computational validity indefinitely.
    
WHAT DigiVax™ IS
    
DigiVax™ is a protocol-level system that makes digital systems provably valid — without migrations, data movement, or trust assumptions.
It installs beneath applications, beneath identity, beneath policy.
•No agents.
•No databases.
•No behavioral analytics.
•No human enforcement loops.
    
THE PROBLEM? (REAL, NOT MARKETING)
    
Every digital system today relies on procedural trust:
•Keys expire
•Policies drift
•Logs are post-hoc
•Compliance is audited after failure
    
Quantum risk requires full-stack migration
This model does not survive:
•Distributed computation
•AI-generated transactions
•Zero-trust sprawl
•Post-quantum cryptography timelines
    
THE DigiVax™ APPROACH
    
DigiVax™ replaces procedural trust with provable digital immunity.
•Trust becomes a property of computation
•Integrity is asserted continuously
•Validation happens at the protocol boundary
•Human intervention is minimized by design
•No system migration required.
•No re-keying.
•No customer data access.
    
WHAT THIS ENABLES?
    
For organizations:
•Eliminate quantum migration risk
•Prove compliance by architecture
•Invalidate stolen credentials, handshakes, and replays
•Stop attacks before identity or IAM is reached
•Assert transaction validity retroactively and indefinitely
For regulators and auditors:
•Deterministic verification
•No reliance on attestations
•No trust in logs
•No ambiguity
    
WHO THIS IS FOR?
    
DigiVax™ is designed for organizations that cannot say no to integrity:
•Cloud and infrastructure providers
•Insurance and financial services
•Healthcare systems
•Regulated enterprises
•Critical digital platforms
    
IMPLEMENTATION MODEL?
    
•Protocol-level integration
•No servers operated by DigiVax™
•No persistent data storage
•No telemetry extraction
•No vendor lock-in
•Integrations complete in days — not years!!!
